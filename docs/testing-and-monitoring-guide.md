# Testing and Monitoring Guide

This guide provides information about testing and monitoring the LFG authentication system, including test types, test files, and monitoring components.

## Testing

### Overview

The authentication system includes comprehensive testing at multiple levels to ensure reliability and correctness. The testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Tests for individual components and services
   - Mock external dependencies for isolation
   - Focus on specific functionality

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Tests for interactions between components
   - Tests for API endpoints and authentication flows
   - Limited mocking of external dependencies

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Tests for complete user journeys
   - Tests for authentication flows from UI to database
   - Minimal mocking, using test accounts where possible

### Test Files

- `/frontend/src/components/auth/__tests__/WalletConnection.test.tsx`: Tests for the WalletConnection component
- `/backend/src/middleware/__tests__/auth.middleware.test.ts`: Tests for the authentication middleware
- `/backend/src/services/__tests__/nillion.service.test.ts`: Tests for the Nillion service
- `/tests/e2e/auth-flow.test.ts`: End-to-end tests for the authentication flow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test

# Run backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Overview

The authentication system includes monitoring and observability features to track performance, errors, and user behavior. This helps identify issues and optimize the system over time.

### Monitoring Components

1. **Request Tracking**:
   - Track API requests and responses
   - Monitor request duration and status codes
   - Identify slow endpoints and errors

2. **Wallet Operation Tracking**:
   - Monitor wallet creation and connection success rates
   - Track wallet operation performance
   - Identify issues with specific wallet providers

3. **Nillion Operation Tracking**:
   - Monitor Nillion API calls
   - Track success rates and performance
   - Identify data synchronization issues

4. **Error Tracking**:
   - Capture and log errors
   - Track error frequency and impact
   - Alert on critical errors

### Implementation

The monitoring system is implemented using a custom monitoring utility that tracks various metrics and logs them for analysis. In a production environment, these metrics would be sent to a monitoring service such as Datadog, New Relic, or CloudWatch.

```typescript
// Example of tracking a wallet operation
monitoring.trackWalletOperation('create', true, 250); // Operation type, success, duration in ms
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

In a production environment, a monitoring dashboard would be set up to visualize the metrics collected by the monitoring system. This dashboard would include:

1. **API Request Metrics**:
   - Request count by endpoint
   - Average response time by endpoint
   - Error rate by endpoint

2. **Wallet Operation Metrics**:
   - Wallet creation success rate
   - Wallet connection success rate
   - Average operation duration

3. **Nillion Operation Metrics**:
   - Data storage success rate
   - Data retrieval success rate
   - Matching operation success rate

4. **Error Metrics**:
   - Error count by type
   - Error count by endpoint
   - Error count by user

### Alerts

Critical issues should trigger alerts to notify the development team. Alerts should be set up for:

1. **High Error Rates**:
   - Alert when error rate exceeds a threshold
   - Alert when specific critical errors occur

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Alert when response time exceeds a threshold
   - Alert when operation duration exceeds a threshold

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Alert when authentication failure rate exceeds a threshold
   - Alert when token verification failure rate exceeds a threshold

4. **Wallet Operation Issues**:
   - Alert when wallet creation failure rate exceeds a threshold
   - Alert when wallet connection failure rate exceeds a threshold

5. **Nillion Operation Issues**:
   - Alert when data storage failure rate exceeds a threshold
   - Alert when data retrieval failure rate exceeds a threshold
   - Alert when matching operation failure rate exceeds a threshold
