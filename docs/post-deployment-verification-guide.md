# Post-Deployment Verification Guide

This guide outlines the steps to verify the LFG platform after deployment to production.

## Automated Verification

### 1. Run End-to-End Tests

```bash
cd tests
TEST_BASE_URL=https://lfg.example.com npm test
```

Verify that all tests pass. If any tests fail:
1. Investigate the failure
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-deploy if necessary
4. Re-run the tests

### 2. API Health Checks

```bash
curl -I https://api.lfg.example.com/health
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
```

### 3. Frontend Health Check

```bash
curl -I https://lfg.example.com
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/2 200
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
```

- Verify that the wallet is connected successfully
- Verify that the wallet address is displayed correctly

#### Logout
- Click the logout button
- Verify that you are logged out
- Verify that you are redirected to the appropriate page

### 2. Nillion Integration

#### Store User Data
- Login to the application
- Update your profile information
- Save the changes
- Verify that the changes are saved successfully
- Verify that the data is stored in Nillion (check logs)

#### Retrieve User Data
- Login to the application
- Navigate to your profile page
- Verify that your profile information is displayed correctly
- Verify that the data is retrieved from Nillion (check logs)

#### Match Bounties
- Login to the application
- Create a new bounty
- Verify that the bounty is created successfully
- Verify that the bounty is matched with appropriate users (check logs)

### 3. Error Handling

#### Invalid Credentials
- Navigate to the login page
- Enter invalid credentials
- Submit the form
- Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed

#### Invalid Token
- Modify a JWT token to be invalid
- Attempt to access a protected route
- Verify that you are redirected to the login page

#### Network Errors
- Simulate a network error (e.g., disconnect from the internet)
- Attempt to perform an action that requires network connectivity
- Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed

## Monitoring Verification

### 1. Check Logs

```bash
# Check backend logs
ssh user@production-server "cd /path/to/backend && pm2 logs lfg-backend"

# Check frontend logs
ssh user@production-server "cd /path/to/frontend && pm2 logs lfg-frontend"
```

Verify that there are no unexpected errors in the logs.

### 2. Check Monitoring Dashboard

- Navigate to your monitoring dashboard (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)
- Verify that all services are up and running
- Verify that there are no critical alerts
- Check the following metrics:
  - API response times
  - Error rates
  - CPU and memory usage
  - Database performance

### 3. Check Error Tracking

- Navigate to your error tracking service (e.g., Sentry)
- Verify that there are no new errors
- If there are new errors:
  1. Investigate the errors
  2. Fix the issues
  3. Re-deploy if necessary

## User Feedback

### 1. Collect User Feedback

- Implement a feedback form in the application
- Monitor support channels for user feedback
- Analyze user behavior using analytics tools

### 2. Respond to Feedback

- Acknowledge user feedback
- Prioritize issues based on impact and frequency
- Plan and implement improvements

### 3. Monitor User Satisfaction

- Track user satisfaction metrics
- Conduct user surveys
- Analyze user retention and engagement

## Continuous Improvement

Based on the verification results and user feedback:

1. Identify areas for improvement
2. Prioritize improvements
3. Plan and implement changes
4. Verify the changes
5. Collect feedback on the changes

## Reporting

Create a post-deployment report that includes:

1. Deployment summary
2. Test results
3. Verification results
4. Monitoring metrics
5. User feedback
6. Recommendations for improvement

Share this report with the team and stakeholders.
