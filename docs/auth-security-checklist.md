# Authentication Security Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive set of security considerations for the LFG authentication system. Use this to ensure that your authentication implementation is secure and follows best practices.

## Token Security

- [ ] **JWT Verification**: Ensure that JWT tokens are properly verified using the correct Privy public key.
- [ ] **Token Expiration**: Verify that tokens have a reasonable expiration time (typically 1-24 hours).
- [ ] **Token Storage**: Store tokens securely in the frontend (memory or secure storage, not localStorage).
- [ ] **Token Transmission**: Only transmit tokens over HTTPS.
- [ ] **Token Revocation**: Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens if needed.

## API Security

- [ ] **HTTPS**: Ensure all API endpoints are served over HTTPS.
- [ ] **CORS**: Configure CORS to only allow requests from trusted domains.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Return generic error messages that don't leak sensitive information.

## Authentication Middleware

- [ ] **Token Presence**: Check that the Authorization header is present and has the correct format.
- [ ] **Token Signature**: Verify the token signature using the correct public key.
- [ ] **Token Claims**: Validate required claims (userId, appId, etc.).
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Handle verification errors gracefully and return appropriate status codes.
- [ ] **Logging**: Log authentication failures (without sensitive information).

## User Management

- [ ] **User Creation**: Validate user data before creating a new user.
- [ ] **User Updates**: Ensure that users can only update their own data.
- [ ] **User Deletion**: Implement secure user deletion that respects data privacy laws.
- [ ] **User Enumeration**: Prevent user enumeration attacks by returning consistent responses.
- [ ] **Sensitive Data**: Ensure sensitive user data is not exposed in API responses.

## Frontend Security

- [ ] **Protected Routes**: Implement protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users.
- [ ] **Conditional Rendering**: Only render sensitive UI elements for authenticated users.
- [ ] **Logout Handling**: Clear authentication state on logout.
- [ ] **Session Timeout**: Implement session timeout for inactive users.
- [ ] **XSS Protection**: Sanitize user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks.

## Wallet Security

- [ ] **Wallet Creation**: Ensure secure wallet creation and storage.
- [ ] **Wallet Connection**: Validate wallet connections to prevent spoofing.
- [ ] **Transaction Signing**: Require explicit user consent for all transactions.
- [ ] **Wallet Address Validation**: Validate wallet addresses before use.
- [ ] **Wallet Recovery**: Implement secure wallet recovery mechanisms.

## Environment Variables

- [ ] **Secret Management**: Store secrets securely and don't commit them to version control.
- [ ] **Production Configs**: Use different configurations for development and production.
- [ ] **Key Rotation**: Implement a process for rotating keys and secrets.
- [ ] **Minimal Permissions**: Use the principle of least privilege for service accounts.
- [ ] **Environment Validation**: Validate required environment variables on startup.

## Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] **Authentication Events**: Log all authentication events (login, logout, token refresh).
- [ ] **Failed Attempts**: Monitor and alert on multiple failed authentication attempts.
- [ ] **Suspicious Activity**: Implement detection for suspicious activity patterns.
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Maintain an audit trail of security-relevant events.
- [ ] **PII Protection**: Ensure logs don't contain personally identifiable information (PII).

## Compliance

- [ ] **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure user data handling complies with GDPR requirements.
- [ ] **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies.
- [ ] **Privacy Policy**: Update privacy policy to reflect authentication practices.
- [ ] **Terms of Service**: Update terms of service to reflect authentication requirements.
- [ ] **Cookie Usage**: Disclose cookie usage and get user consent if required.

## Incident Response

- [ ] **Security Contacts**: Establish security contacts and responsible disclosure policy.
- [ ] **Breach Response**: Develop a plan for responding to security breaches.
- [ ] **Token Invalidation**: Ability to invalidate all tokens in case of a breach.
- [ ] **User Notification**: Process for notifying users of security incidents.
- [ ] **Recovery Procedures**: Document recovery procedures for security incidents.

## Testing

- [ ] **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing of authentication system.
- [ ] **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Implement and test security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.).
- [ ] **Authentication Bypass**: Test for authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Session Management**: Test session management for security issues.

## Third-Party Integrations

- [ ] **Privy Security**: Review Privy's security practices and compliance certifications.
- [ ] **Supabase Security**: Review Supabase's security practices and compliance certifications.
- [ ] **Webhook Security**: Secure webhook endpoints with proper authentication.
- [ ] **API Keys**: Rotate third-party API keys regularly.
- [ ] **Vendor Assessment**: Conduct security assessments of third-party vendors.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] **Code Review**: Conduct security-focused code review of authentication implementation.
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Run static analysis tools to identify security issues.
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**: Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Secret Scanning**: Scan codebase for accidentally committed secrets.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document security considerations and practices.

## Regular Maintenance

- [ ] **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Security Patches**: Apply security patches promptly.
- [ ] **Configuration Review**: Regularly review security configurations.
- [ ] **Access Review**: Regularly review access to production systems and data.
- [ ] **Security Training**: Provide security training for developers.
